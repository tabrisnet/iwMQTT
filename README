Recommended to add to your HA config, if you have the InfluxDB integration.
Why? Because most likely you are already using the InfluxDB uploader anyway, right?

influxdb:
  api_version: 2
  exclude:
    entity_globs:
      # we don't need the Watts/PF/Amps/Hz b/c that's already in InfluxDB
      # but the other statistics are potentially useful
      - sensor.iotawatt_*_Amps
      - sensor.iotawatt_*_Watts
      - sensor.iotawatt_*_Pf
      - sensor.iotawatt_*_hz
      - sensor.iotawatt_*_Vrms
      - sensor.iotawatt_*_influxdb2_last_update # backlog is a good stat tho
      - sensor.iotawatt_*_current_time
