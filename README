Perl IoTaWatt to MQTT bridge

NOTE: As of 2025May01, the docker and homeassistant addon machinery is untested.
But the base perl code does work [or at least, it works for me].

package needs:
Debian: libanyevent-http-perl
Debian: libmodule-pluggable-perl
Debian: libsub-name-perl
Debian: libyaml-tiny-perl
Debian: libjson-xs-perl

alpine calls them:

perl-anyevent-http
perl-module-pluggable
perl-sub-name
perl-yaml-tiny - only used for the config file
perl-json-xs

contains:
AnyEvent::MQTT 1.212810 as of 2025Apr22
Net::MQTT 1.163170 as of 2025Apr22
